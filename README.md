Some notes and example codes for OpenCV, I will try my best to make the codes works for OpenCV 2.x (2.4.11) and OpenCV 3.x (3.3.0).

And there is one repository called [pose-estimation](https://github.com/MiaoDX/pose_estimation) where I do lots of experiments on feature detection and camera pose calibration, codes in both C++ and python, please give it a look :)

Good Luck & Have Fun.
